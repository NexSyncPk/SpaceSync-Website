# MyOrganization Auto-Navigation Issue - Fix

## Problem

When clicking on "My Organization" button, the MyOrganization page opens but immediately routes to the home page without the user clicking "Enter in Organization" button.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Flow That Caused the Issue:

1. User clicks "My Organization" → `MyOrganization.tsx` component mounts
2. `useEffect` runs → calls `fetchUserOrganization()` AND `forceRefreshOrganizationData()`
3. `forceRefreshOrganizationData()` → calls `refreshAllOrganizationData()` in userService
4. `refreshAllOrganizationData()` → automatically calls `store.dispatch(setOrganization(orgData))` (lines 142-143 and 152-153)
5. Setting organization state → sets `hasSelectedOrganization` to `true` in Redux
6. `Organization.tsx` component's `useEffect` detects `hasSelectedOrganization === true`
7. Auto-navigation triggers → `navigate("/", { replace: true })` (line 26 in Organization.tsx)

### The Problematic Code:

**In `userService.ts` (lines 142-143 and 152-153):**

```typescript
const { setOrganization } = await import("@/store/slices/organizationSlice");
store.dispatch(setOrganization(orgData)); // This automatically sets organization state!
```

**In `Organization.tsx` (lines 24-28):**

```typescript
// If user has selected an organization, redirect to home
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasSelectedOrganization) {
    navigate("/", { replace: true }); // Auto-navigation happens here!
  }
}, [hasSelectedOrganization, navigate]);
```

**In `MyOrganization.tsx` (lines 24-30):**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserOrganization();
  // This was triggering the auto-navigation!
  if (user?.organizationId) {
    forceRefreshOrganizationData(user.organizationId); // This sets org state!
  }
}, []);
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied:

**Removed the call to `forceRefreshOrganizationData()` from `MyOrganization.tsx`**

**Before:**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserOrganization();
  // Also refresh organization data to ensure we have the latest member count
  if (user?.organizationId) {
    forceRefreshOrganizationData(user.organizationId); // REMOVED THIS
  }
}, []);
```

**After:**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUserOrganization();
  // Don't call forceRefreshOrganizationData here as it sets organization state
  // which triggers automatic navigation to home page
}, []);
```

Also updated the refresh button to not call the problematic function.

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Prevents Automatic State Setting**: By not calling `forceRefreshOrganizationData()`, we prevent the automatic setting of organization state when just viewing organization details.

2. **Preserves User Intent**: The organization state is now only set when the user explicitly clicks "Enter in Organization" button, which is the intended behavior.

3. **Maintains Functionality**: The component still fetches and displays organization data via `fetchUserOrganization()`, but doesn't set the global organization state automatically.

## Current Behavior (After Fix)

1. User clicks "My Organization" → Page opens and stays open ✅
2. User can view organization details, members, rooms ✅
3. User clicks "Enter in Organization" → Sets organization state → Navigates to home ✅
4. User clicks "Back" → Returns to organization selection ✅

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Modify the auto-navigation logic**: Could add conditions to prevent navigation from MyOrganization page
2. **Change when `hasSelectedOrganization` is set**: Could modify the Redux logic
3. **Remove auto-navigation entirely**: Could remove the useEffect in Organization.tsx

The chosen solution is the cleanest as it follows the principle that viewing data shouldn't change application state - only explicit user actions should.

## Files Modified

- `src/components/modules/Organization/MyOrganization.tsx` - Removed automatic organization state setting

## Testing

1. ✅ Click "My Organization" → Page opens and stays
2. ✅ View organization details → No auto-navigation
3. ✅ Click "Enter in Organization" → Navigates to home
4. ✅ Organization data still displays correctly
5. ✅ Member count and room count still show correctly
